FLAC is open source software that can reduce the amount of storage space needed
to store digital audio signals without needing to remove information in doing
so. The files read and produced by this software are called FLAC files. As
these files (which follow the FLAC format) can be read from and written to by
other software as well, this software is often referred to as the FLAC
reference implementation.
